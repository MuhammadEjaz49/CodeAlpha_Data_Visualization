## 📊 Data Visualization Project – Titanic Dataset | CodeAlpha

This project is part of my **Data Science Internship at CodeAlpha**, focusing on Data Visualization.
The objective is to transform raw Titanic passenger data into meaningful visual insights that support analysis and decision-making.

### 🚀 Project Overview

Using **Python**, I analyzed the Titanic dataset and created clear, informative visualizations to understand survival patterns based on different factors.

---

### 🛠 Tools & Technologies

* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib

---

### 📈 Visualizations Included

* Survival count (Survived vs Not Survived)
* Survival rate by gender
* Survival rate by passenger class
* Age distribution of passengers

---

### 💡 Key Insights

* Female passengers had a higher survival rate than males
* First-class passengers were more likely to survive
* Most passengers were between 20–40 years old
* Survival was influenced by social and demographic factors
